The ``changelog.d`` Directory
=============================

.. -text-begin-

A "Changelog" is a record of all notable changes made to a project. Such
a changelog, in our case the :file:`CHANGELOG.rst`, is read by our *users*.
Therefor, any description should be aimed to users instead of describing
internal changes which are only relevant to developers.

To avoid merge conflicts, we use the towncrier_ package to manage our changelog.

The directory :file:`changelog.d` contains "newsfragments" which are short
ReST-formatted files.
On release, those news fragments are compiled into our :file:`CHANGELOG.rst`.

You don't need to install ``towncrier`` yourself, use the :command:`tox` command
to call the tool.

We recommend to follow the steps to make a smooth integration of your changes:

#. After you have created a new pull request (PR), add a new file into the
   directory :file:`changelog.d`. Each filename follows the syntax::

    <ISSUE>.<TYPE>.rst

   where ``<ISSUE>`` is the pull request number, and ``<TYPE>`` is one of:

   * ``bugfix``: fixes a reported bug.
   * ``deprecation``: informs about deprecation warnings
   * ``doc``: improves documentation.
   * ``feature``: adds new user facing features.
   * ``removal``: removes obsolete or deprecated features.
   * ``trivial``: fixes a small typo or internal change that might be noteworthy.

   For example: ``123.feature.rst``, ``456.bugfix.rst`` etc.

#. Create the new file with the command::

     tox -e changelog -- create 123.feature.rst

   The file is created int the :file:`changelog.d` directory.

#. Open the file and add describe your changes.

   * Wrap symbols like modules, functions, or classes into double backticks
     so they are rendered in a ``monospace font``.
   * Prefer simple past tense or constructions with "now".

#. Check your changes with::

     tox -e changelog -- check

#. Optionally, build a draft version of the changelog file with the command::

    tox -e changelog

#. Commit all your changes and push it.


This finishes your steps.

On release, the maintainer compiles a new :file:`CHANGELOG.rst` file by running::

   tox -e changelog -- build

This will remove all newsfragments inside the :file:`changelog.d` directory,
making it ready for the next release.
