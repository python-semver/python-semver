:meth:`~semver.version.Version.bump_prerelease` will now add `.0` to an
existing prerelease when the last segment of the current prerelease, split by
dots (`.`), is not numeric. This is to ensure the new prerelease is considered
higher than the previous one.

:meth:`~semver.version.Version.bump_prerelease` now also support an argument
`bump_when_empty` which will bump the patch version if there is no existing
prerelease, to ensure the resulting version is considered a higher version than
the previous one.
