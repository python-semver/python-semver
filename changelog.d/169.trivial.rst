Adapted infrastructure code to the new project layout.

* Replace :file:`setup.py` with :file:`setup.cfg` because the :file:`setup.cfg` is easier to use
* Adapt documentation code snippets where needed
* Adapt tests
* Changed the ``deprecated`` to hardcode the ``semver`` package name in the warning.

Increase coverage to 100% for all non-deprecated APIs
