Version 3.0.0
=============

:Released: 2023-04-02
:Maintainer: Tom Schraitle


Bug Fixes
---------

* :gh:`291`: Disallow negative numbers in VersionInfo arguments
  for ``major``, ``minor``, and ``patch``.

* :gh:`310`: Rework API documentation.
  Follow a more "semi-manual" attempt and add auto directives
  into :file:`docs/api.rst`.

* :gh:`344`: Allow empty string, a string with a prefix, or ``None``
  as token in
  :meth:`~semver.version.Version.bump_build` and
  :meth:`~semver.version.Version.bump_prerelease`.

* :gh:`374`: Correct Towncrier's config entries in the :file:`pyproject.toml` file.
  The old entries ``[[tool.towncrier.type]]`` are deprecated and need
  to be replaced by ``[tool.towncrier.fragment.<TYPE>]``.

* :pr:`384`: General cleanup, reformat files:

  * Reformat source code with black again as some config options
    did accidentely exclude the semver source code.
    Mostly remove some includes/excludes in the black config.
  * Integrate concurrency in GH Action
  * Ignore Python files on project dirs in .gitignore
  * Remove unused patterns in MANIFEST.in
  * Use ``extend-exclude`` for flake in :file:`setup.cfg`` and adapt list.
  * Use ``skip_install=True`` in :file:`tox.ini` for black

* :pr:`393`: Fix command :command:`python -m semver` to avoid the error "invalid choice"

* :pr:`396`: Calling :meth:`~semver.version.Version.parse` on a derived class will show correct type of derived class.


Deprecations
------------

* :gh:`169`: Deprecate CLI functions not imported from ``semver.cli``.

* :gh:`234`: In :file:`setup.py` simplified file and remove
  ``Tox`` and ``Clean`` classes

* :gh:`284`: Deprecate the use of :meth:`~Version.isvalid`.

  Rename :meth:`~semver.version.Version.isvalid`
  to :meth:`~semver.version.Version.is_valid`
  for consistency reasons with :meth:`~semver.version.Version.is_compatible`.


* :pr:`290`: For semver 3.0.0-alpha0 deprecated:

  * Remove anything related to Python2
  * In :file:`tox.ini` and :file:`.travis.yml`
    Remove targets py27, py34, py35, and pypy.
    Add py38, py39, and nightly (allow to fail)
  * In :file:`setup.py` simplified file and remove
    ``Tox`` and ``Clean`` classes
  * Remove old Python versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and pypy)
    from Travis

* :gh:`372`: Deprecate support for Python 3.6.

  Python 3.6 reached its end of life and isn't supported anymore.
  At the time of writing (Dec 2022), the lowest version is 3.7.

  Although the `poll <https://github.com/python-semver/python-semver/discussions/371>`_
  didn't cast many votes, the majority agreed to remove support for
  Python 3.6.

* :pr:`402`: Keep :func:`semver.compare <semver._deprecated.compare>`.
   Although it breaks consistency with module level functions, it seems it's
   a much needed/used function. It's still unclear if we should deprecate
   this function or not (that's why we use :py:exc:`PendingDeprecationWarning`).

   As we don't have a uniform initializer yet, this function stays in the
   :file:`_deprecated.py` file for the time being until we find a better solution. See :gh:`258` for details.


Features
--------

* :gh:`169`: Create semver package and split code among different modules in the packages:

  * Remove :file:`semver.py`
  * Create :file:`src/semver/__init__.py`
  * Create :file:`src/semver/cli.py` for all CLI methods
  * Create :file:`src/semver/_deprecated.py` for the ``deprecated`` decorator and other deprecated functions
  * Create :file:`src/semver/__main__.py` to allow calling the CLI using :command:`python -m semver`
  * Create :file:`src/semver/_types.py` to hold type aliases
  * Create :file:`src/semver/version.py` to hold the :class:`Version` class (old name :class:`VersionInfo`) and its utility functions
  * Create :file:`src/semver/__about__.py` for all the metadata variables

* :gh:`213`: Add typing information

* :gh:`284`: Implement :meth:`~semver.version.Version.is_compatible` to make "is self compatible with X".

* :gh:`305`: Rename :class:`~semver.version.VersionInfo` to :class:`~semver.version.Version` but keep an alias for compatibility

* :pr:`359`: Add optional parameter ``optional_minor_and_patch`` in :meth:`~semver.version.Version.parse`  to allow optional
  minor and patch parts.

* :pr:`362`: Make :meth:`~semver.version.Version.match` accept a bare version string as match expression, defaulting to equality testing.

  * Doc: Describe building of semver
  * Remove :file:`.travis.yml` in :file:`MANIFEST.in`
    (not needed anymore)
  * Distinguish between Python 3.6 and others in :file:`tox.ini`
  * Add skip_missing_interpreters option for :file:`tox.ini`
  * GH Action: Upgrade setuptools and setuptools-scm and test
    against 3.11.0-rc.2



Improved Documentation
----------------------

* :gh:`276`: Document how to create a sublass from :class:`~semver.version.VersionInfo` class

  * Mention the rename of :class:`~semver.version.VersionInfo` to
    :class:`~semver.version.Version` class
  * Remove semver. prefix in doctests to make examples shorter
  * Correct some references to dunder methods like
    :func:`~semver.version.Version.__getitem__`,

    deprecated and discouraged from using
  * Make empty :py:func:`super` call in :file:`semverwithvprefix.py` example

  * "Migration to semver3"
  * "Advanced topics"

* :pr:`392`: Fix the example in the documentation for combining semver and pydantic.


Trivial/Internal Changes
------------------------

* :gh:`169`: Adapted infrastructure code to the new project layout.

  * Replace :file:`setup.py` with :file:`setup.cfg` because the :file:`setup.cfg` is easier to use
  * Adapt documentation code snippets where needed
  * Adapt tests
  * Changed the ``deprecated`` to hardcode the ``semver`` package name in the warning.

  Increase coverage to 100% for all non-deprecated APIs

* :pr:`290`: Add supported Python versions to :command:`black`.

* :gh:`304`: Support PEP-561 :file:`py.typed`.

  According to the mentioned PEP:

    "Package maintainers who wish to support type checking
    of their code MUST add a marker file named :file:`py.typed`
    to their package supporting typing."

  Add package_data to :file:`setup.cfg` to include this marker in dist
  and whl file.

* :gh:`309`: Some (private) functions from the :mod:`semver.version`
  module has been changed.

  The following functions got renamed:

  * function :func:`semver.version.comparator` got renamed to
    :func:`semver.version._comparator` as it is only useful
    inside the :class:`~semver.version.Version` class.
  * function :func:`semver.version.cmp` got renamed to
    :func:`semver.version._cmp` as it is only useful
    inside the :class:`~semver.version.Version` class.

  The following functions got integrated into the
  :class:`~semver.version.Version` class:

  * function :func:`semver.version._nat_cmd` as a classmethod
  * function :func:`semver.version.ensure_str`

* :gh:`313`: Correct :file:`tox.ini` for ``changelog`` entry to skip
  installation for semver. This should speed up the execution
  of towncrier.

* :gh:`316`: Comparisons of :class:`~semver.version.Version` class and other
  types return now a :py:const:`NotImplemented` constant instead
  of a :py:exc:`TypeError` exception.

  The `NotImplemented`_ section of the Python documentation recommends
  returning this constant when comparing with ``__gt__``, ``__lt__``,
  and other comparison operators to "to indicate that the operation is
  not implemented with respect to the other type".

  .. _NotImplemented: https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented

* :gh:`319`: Introduce stages in :file:`.travis.yml`
  The config file contains now two stages: check and test. If
  check fails, the test stage won't be executed. This could
  speed up things when some checks fails.

* :gh:`322`: Switch from Travis CI to GitHub Actions.

* :gh:`347`: Support Python 3.10 in GitHub Action and other config files.

* :gh:`378`: Fix some typos in Towncrier configuration

* :gh:`388`: For pytest, switch to the more modern :mod:`importlib` approach
  as it doesn't require to modify :data:`sys.path`:
  https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/explanation/pythonpath.html

* :pr:`389`: Add public class variable :data:`Version.NAMES <semver.version.Version.NAMES>`.

  This class variable contains a tuple of strings that contains the names of
  all attributes of a Version (like ``"major"``, ``"minor"`` etc).

  In cases we need to have dynamical values, this makes it easier to iterate.
